A minimal HTTP server in python. It sends a JSON Hello World for GET requests, and echoes back JSON for POST requests.

Adapted from [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/bradmontgomery/2219997), with the addition of code for reading the request body taken from [this article](http://mafayyaz.wordpress.com/2013/02/08/writing-simple-http-server-in-python-with-rest-and-json/).
