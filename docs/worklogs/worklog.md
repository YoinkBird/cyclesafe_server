# Goal

1. Containerise cyclesafe_server and modelgen,
2. Replace orchestration bash+linux setup.sh orchestration with 
3. docker fundamentals.
4. Then implement orchestration using docker-compose to (mostly) replace setup.sh.
5. Continue to implement orchestration using k8s+k3d

# Phase 1

containerize model generation



# Phase 2

containerize server setup

# Phase 3
